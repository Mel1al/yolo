 <B>Hello, my name is Kirill
I am 17 years old, I am a second-year student of the KS #54 on the specialty of information security of telecommunication systems, in other words, ensuring cybersecurity
I was born in a small town in Russia, received a basic general education there, thanks to a good average score of my certificate, roads to some of the best colleges in Moscow were opened to me.
In my educational institution, there was no computer science as such, so training for the chosen specialty is far from easy, but interest in this field awakens in me a huge craving for studying all aspects of information security.
I have no interest as such. Once I was engaged in martial arts, like most teenagers in Russia, whom parents sent to the section only for the sake of a tick, for a long time I was not enough and I finished visiting the section. Much more I liked to spend time at the computer, I did not understand much, but to play games, watch animated seriesI definitely liked it better at the computer. Now I really like the direction I chose and I in no way regret the choice I made once.
Speaking of the double degree program, I sincerely hope that it will give me tremendous prospects in working abroad and maybe even living there permanently.
After 5 years, I see myself even more purposeful, perhaps I will still be a little lazy, but doing what I love, getting paid for it (probably this is already a dream, but I believe in it)
I will make every effort to make all my plans, goals and expectations come true. </B></FONT><BR></P>
